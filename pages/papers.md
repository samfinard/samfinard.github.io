## How to read papers

*from: [Career Advice / Reading Research Papers by Andrew NG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733m6qBH-jI)*

1. put pdf or link in Zotero
2. Briefly skim headers
   - Read abstract, intro, and conclusion. Highlight the outline of their paper.
3. Read entire paper slowly, highlighting terms I don't know
    - Google definitions
4. Take 10-20 min break
5. Read entire paper and try to replicate their conclusion by yourself
