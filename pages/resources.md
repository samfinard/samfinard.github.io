## Where to find good papers

- [quantamagazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org) - for CS and Math. Blog post about academic papers. 
  - They also have a very interesting [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@QuantaScienceChannel) - my favorites are the yearly reviews in Math, CS, and Physics.
- [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/) - Thorough repository for Math, CS, and Quantitative Finance papers.
- [jstor](https://www.jstor.org/) - High quality academic papers with detailed querying options so you can search for exactly what you want. *Requires school login.*
- [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) - The standard free search service for academic content.


## How to read papers

*Inspired from [Career Advice / Reading Research Papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733m6qBH-jI) by Andrew Ng*

1. Add pdf or link into [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).
2. Briefly skim headers
   - Read abstract, intro, and conclusion
   - Highlight the outline of the paper
3. Read the entire paper slowly while highlighting any unknown terms
    - Google definitions as you go
4. Take 10-20 min break
5. Read entire paper and try to replicate their conclusion by yourself
