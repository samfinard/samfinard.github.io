## About Me

🧑‍💻 Working as a financial analyst supporting the trading desk at SMBC

💿 Comfortable implementing technical solutions using Python, SQLite, xlwings,  COM objects, and VBA

📚 Graduated NYU in December 2024 with a major in Computer Science and minors in Math and Music.

### [Data Structures & Algorithms](../_pages/dsa.md)

I enjoy learning about Data Structures & Algorithms because it gives me a foundational base which all my solutions as a software engineer build upon.

### [Interesting Papers](../_pages/papers.md)

This is a complete catalogue of all the academic papers/textbooks I've read since June 2023. Most of them are about data storage, data processing at scale,  and artifical intelligence. Recently I have been reading more quantitative finance and mathematics papers.
